Hi! My name is Josef, I'm born in Austria and currently living in The Netherlands, where I am pursuing a [PhD degree](https://people.utwente.nl/j.heel) at the IC design group of [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/). My project is focused on improving high-speed data converters for communication applications with input bandwidths around 20-35 GHz. Previously, I did my master's degree at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home/), also focusing on analog/mixed signal IC design.

Besides education, I worked at two startups, designing custom energy metering electronics and doing hardware and embedded software design for custom [IoT-solutions](https://www.sloc.one/). In the academic year 2020/2021, I updated teaching materials and helped out in the RF lab at the [Institute of Microwave and Photonic Engineering (IHF)](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ihf/home/) of TU Graz as a student assistent. Mainly in the winter term 2021/22, I did my [master's thesis](../electronics/projects/2022/06/27/master-thesis/) project in cooperation with ams-OSRAM AG. See also on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josefheel).

Apart from that, my interests cover designing general electronic circuits and PCBs, working with microcontrollers and doing the mechanical integration of a product. On the software side, I've worked on multiple embeddedd system platforms programming in C, and I also like Python a lot for PC-related tasks such as data analysis or GUI programming. Repairing electronic appliances can be an interesting challenge too, this why I sometimes help out at the local repair cafe initiative. 

In my free time, I like to create things and pursue projects including electronics, mechanics, software, woodworking and such. If mechanics, electronics and software are combined in one project, this is where it usually gets really exciting. Check out this website to get an impression. Besides technology, I enjoy endurance sports such as mountaineering, cycling, bike packing, hiking and back-country skiing.
