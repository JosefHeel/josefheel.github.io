Hi! My name is Josef, I'm from Austria, and I like like engineering! At the moment, I am in the final semester of my master's degree in electrical engineering at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home/). Prior to that, I attended the HTL (technical college) for Electronics and Computer Engineering in Innsbruck.

Besides school, I worked at a startup designing custom energy metering solutions and did a couple of paid projects for other companies. For two years then, I was employed by another [startup](https://www.sloc.one/) doing hard- and software design, creating custom IoT-solutions. In the academic year 2020/2021, I was employed a student assistant at the [Institute of Microwave and Photonic Engineering (IHF)](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ihf/home/) at TU Graz. Mainly the winter term 2021/22 but still ongoing, I am working on a master thesis project in cooperation with ams-OSRAM AG. See also on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josefheel).

My main interests lie in analog and mixed-signal chip design, towards which I directed my university education in the last two years by choosing the "Analog Chip Design" course program at Graz University of technology. The first major working experience there is the master thesis project "Low Noise Sensor Interface", with the aim to analyze and optimize electrical noise in an existing sensor frontend. I plan to further deepen my knowledge by doing a PhD in the field of microelectronics.

Other than that, my interests cover designing general electronic circuits and PCBs, working with microcontrollers and doing the mechanical integration of a product. Mostly, I am programming in C, which is of course common on microcontrollers, but also like python a lot for PC-related tasks such as data analysis or GUI programming. To me, circuit design, RF and control systems for mechanical machines are the most interesting fields, although every domain has its own challenges and surprises.

In my free time, I like to create things and pursue projects including electronics, mechanics, software, woodworking and such. If mechanics, electronics and software are combined in one project, this is where it usually gets really exciting. Check out this website to get an impression. Besides technology, I enjoy endurance sports such as mountaineering, cycling, hiking and ski-touring.
