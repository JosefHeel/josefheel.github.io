Hi! My name is Josef, I'm from Austria, and I like building stuff. At the moment, I am in the fourth year studying electrical engineering at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home/). Prior to that, I attended the HTL (technical college) for Electronics and Computer Engineering in Innsbruck.

Besides school, I worked at a startup designing custom energy metering solutions and did a couple of paid projects for other companies. For two years then, I was employed by another [startup](https://www.sloc.one/) doing hard- and software design, creating custom IoT-solutions. Currently, I am a student assistant at the [Institute of Microwave and Photonic Engineering (IHF)](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ihf/home/) at TU Graz. See also on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josefheel).

My main interests are designing electronic circuits and PCBs, working with microcontrollers and doing the mechanical integration of a product. Mostly, I am programming in C, which is of course common on microcontrollers, but also like python a lot for PC-related tasks such as data analysis or GUI programming. To me, discrete electronics, RF and control systems for mechanical machines are the most interesting fields, although every domain has its own challenges and surprises.

In my free time, I like to create things and pursue projects including electronics, mechanics, software, woodworking and such. If mechanics, electronics and software are combined in one project, this is where it usually gets really exciting. Check out this website to get an impression. Besides technology, I enjoy endurance sports such as mountaineering, cycling, hiking and ski-touring.
