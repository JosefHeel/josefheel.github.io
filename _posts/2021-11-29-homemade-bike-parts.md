#### A quick little project
A friend of mine who is quite into bicycles asked me if we could manufacture some aluminium parts for an old racing bike. There was only one store that would sell the appropriate ones, and those were neither aesthetic nor cheap. So he made a drawing and we spend a fun evening in the basement. Most of the work is done on the lathe, of course, including the threading.

The flat on the side of the screw that prevents it from turning when rotating the nut was a good opportunity to use the [CNC router](/cnc/2020/03/31/cnc-screen-printer/). In fact, we machined the screw first but left it connected to the stock material to be able to grab it properly in a vise for milling. After that, we finished the other side gently by screwing the thread into a nut in the chuck.
