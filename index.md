Welcome to my personal website! With this web appearance, I would like to
give you an insight in some things I do out of personal interest. As a
hobby, I have always worked on all sorts of technical projects, be it mechanical,
electrical or software-related. Some of those are presented here, alongside with
thoughts, ideas, and other stuff - so enjoy.
